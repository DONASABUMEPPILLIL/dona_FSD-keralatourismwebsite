    <h3>KERALA</h3>
   
    <p>
        Parasurama threw his ax across the sea, and the water receded as far as it reached. According to legend, this new area of land
         extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari. The land which rose from sea was filled with salt and was unsuitable for habitation; so 
         Parasurama invoked the Snake King Vasuki, who spat the holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out of 
         respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land.

Another much earlier Puranic character associated with Kerala is Mahabali, an Asura and a prototypical just king, who ruled the 
earth from Kerala. He won the war against the Devas, driving them into exile. The Devas pleaded before Lord Vishnu, who took his
 fifth incarnation as Vamana and pushed Mahabali down to the netherworld to placate the Devas. Lord Vishnu, seeing the devotion
  of Mahabali, blessed him to be the Indra of the next Manvantara. There is a belief that, once a year during the Onam festival,
   Mahabali returns to Kerala. It is said that the god Vishnu is guarding Mahabali's Kingdom as a mark of respect for his virtues.

The Matsya Purana, one of the oldest of the 18 Puranas, uses the Malaya Mountains of Kerala (and Tamil Nadu) as the setting
 for the story of Matsya, the first incarnation of Vishnu, and Manu, the first man and the king of the region.These
  Puranic accounts portray Kerala as "Godâ€™s own country", or the land favoured by God. The description of Kerala
   as "God's own country" can additionally be traced to the event known as Thrippadidanam, in which in 1749-50,
    the then ruler Marthanda Varma, Maharaja of Travancore, decided to "donate" his realm to Sri Padmanabha (Vishnu)
     and thereafter rule as the deity's "vicegerent" (Sri Padmanabha Dasa).The slogan also alludes to the variety
      of faiths in the state: Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Jains, Jews, and Parsis (Zoroastrians) have coexisted 
    harmoniously for centuries as the mishmash of temples, towers, spires and synagogues attest.
